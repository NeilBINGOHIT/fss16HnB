###Paper
An Empirical Investigation into the Role of API-Level Refactorings during Software Evolution, by Miryung Kim, Dongxiang Cai and Sunghun Kim, presented in 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), 2011.

###Summary
Refactoring is the process of changing a programs’ design structure without modifying its external functional behavior in order to improve program readability, maintainability and extensibility. 
Relevant studies show different results between refactoring and following bug fixes. The goal of this paper is to systematically investigate the role of refactorings during the software evolution by examining the relationships between refactorings, bug fixes, the time to resolve bugs and release cycles using fine-grained version histories.

###Keywords
1. API – Level Refactoring

2. Floss Refactoring

###Features
1. Motivational Statement  
In theory, refactoring improves software quality and programmers’ productivity. However, in practice there are trends that show increase in bug reports after refactoring. This motivates the authors to dig deeper and systematically investigate the role of refactoring. The idea is to establish a relationship between refactorings, bug fixes, the time to resolve bugs and release cycles. 

2. Related Work  
A study found that a high ratio of refactorings is sometimes followed by an increasing ratio of bug reports. And a contradicting study found that the number of defects decreases if the number of refactorings increases in the preceding time period.
